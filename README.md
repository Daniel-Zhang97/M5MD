# Mission 5 - Codename:MetroFall

Welcome to Codename:Metrofall. The purpose of this mission was to showcase collaboration between UX and Devs as well as demonstrating competency in our respective fields. 

In this project, we were tasked with creating an application based on the prototype design received from UX Designers at the end of Week 1. Each developer must work on at least one screen of the application, encompassing both frontend and backend functionalities.

The keys to sucess in the mission are empathy, compromise, and communication. 

Throughout the project we have used daily stand-ups as our main way of having an organised gathering where we share our progress.





## Project Description

Our application is built using React.js and incorporates a MongoDB backend. It is designed to fulfill specific requirements outlined in the project brief. While we were encouraged to re-use the architecture from Week 1, our development process involved refining the initial design and implementing necessary features.

## Key features
 - Frontend and Backend Integration: Each screen seamlessly integrates frontend and backend functionalities.
- MongoDB Database: We've employed MongoDB to efficiently manage data.
- Deployment: The application is deployable using Docker Compose.
- Collaboration: We utilized GitHub for collaborative discussions and to share common components among developers.
